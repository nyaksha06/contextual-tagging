## Contextual Tagging System

# Description

The Contextual Tagging System is a powerful NLP project designed to categorize text content into specific topics. Utilizing a tokenizer from a pretrained model and transformers from Hugging Face, the system accurately tags text based on its context, assigning it to one of the predefined topics. This makes it an ideal tool for organizing and categorizing large volumes of text data.
